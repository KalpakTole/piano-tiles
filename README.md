# piano-tiles

Hello everyone,
Kalpak here. I like Computer Games! My Steam name is DonkeyHopper so drop a Hii when you come across! Okay back to business :)

I like Python programming and also making/automating cool games in Python; this is one of my cool projects-

This is a Python program to automate the popular Piano Tiles game. All it needs is a Piano Tiles game found online or by screen mirroring from an Android mobile.

__These are the instructions to run:__

___This game is made considering the resolution of my monitor which is 1366*768. If you do not have the same resolution, the game *may* not work.___

The website for playing Piano Tiles is this:
http://tanksw.com/piano-tiles/

The current version of this program is made for online game only and not mobile game using screen mirroring. This is because screen mirroring causes delay/input lag and guess what, this game hates delays!

Open the above site in a browswer and select Arcade mode.
Place your cursor inside the actual game area.
Since the program is not converted to an executable file yet, you need to compile it using normal Python compilation process - 
Open Command Prompt and go to the address where you have stored this file on your hard disk, type "python capture_screen.py" (without quotes).
VIOLA! The cursor automatically moves and clicks on black tiles! The highest score I could get is 712 :)
Go ahead and beat my high score! Enjoy :)
